# Sectional — Light Rig Scaler

A static site (a single `index.html`, no build step) that scales the light rig
for sectional sofas to the required dimensions and outputs a ready-to-use **T3D** for pasting
into Unreal via `Ctrl + V`.

## How to use

1. Open the site.
2. Enter the sofa dimensions: **Width (X)**, **Depth (Y)**, **Height (Z)** in cm.
3. Click **"Copy"**.
4. In Unreal: click in the level viewport → `Ctrl + V`. Five lights will appear
   (`front_fill_lgt`, `main_key_lgt`, `left_rim_lgt`, `right_bounce_lgt`, `right_rim_lgt`)
   in the `Lights` folder.

Render previews are loaded from the server when matching files exist under
`Renders/<material>/<render-prefix>_<shot-suffix>.png` next to `index.html`.
There is no browser drag-drop upload; missing render files are simply hidden.
For TQ shots, left-arm presets show server renders only in `TQ-L`;
right-arm presets only in `TQ-R`. `F` and `FH` renders stay available.
The bundled default preset is `KOPER_LEFT_ARM_L_SECTIONAL_prod39250480`
with dimensions `453 x 274 x 77`.

> When you enter dimensions equal to the reference ones (453 × 274 × 77), the output matches
> the original rig byte for byte — a handy way to verify that nothing has "drifted".

## Scaling logic

| What | Rule |
|---|---|
| Positions | per-coordinate: `X·(W/453)`, `Y·(D/274)`, `Z·(H/77)` |
| Light distance | `k = |new_pos| / |old_pos|` (individual to each light) |
| Intensity, mode **A** | light sizes `×k`, intensity `×k²` (inverse square holds strictly) |
| Intensity, mode **B** | sizes unchanged, `I·(k²·d² + R²)/(d² + R²) ≈ I·k^p`, where `p = 2d²/(d²+R²)` |
| AttenuationRadius | `×k` (follows the distance) |
| Rotations, color, temperature | unchanged |

- **Axes:** world X ↔ width (453), Y ↔ depth (274), Z ↔ height (77). Determined by
  the fill: `SourceWidth = 500 ≈ 453`. The "rotated 90°" checkbox swaps X↔Y.
- **Mode A** — recommended: preserves the character of the shadows, with predictable `k²`.
- **Mode B** — explains why "inverse square doesn't work": for large soft
  lights (fill, left_rim), `R` is comparable to the distance → softer falloff (`~k^1.7`),
  while for the sharp `main_key` → almost `k²`.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

**Option 1 — separate repository:**
```bash
# copy the contents of light-rig-web/ into a new repository
git init && git add . && git commit -m "light rig scaler"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin <repo-url>
git push -u origin main
```
Settings → Pages → Source: `main` / `/ (root)`. Site: `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/`.

**Option 2 — `/docs` folder in the current repository:**
rename `light-rig-web/` → `docs/`, then in Settings → Pages choose `main` / `/docs`.

No build is required — this is a pure static file.

For the preview deployment used in production, keep the deployed folder together with its
`Renders/` directory so the relative image URLs resolve correctly.
